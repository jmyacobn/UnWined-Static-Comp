# 🍷 UnWined-Static-Comp 🍷

## Overview and Context
The static comp challenge is assigned during Week 3 of Module 2 at Turing School of Software Development and Design so that we can continue to grow our HTML and CSS muscles 💪. We were allowed creative license with the theme, images, and text. I built my site UnWined to match [this comp](https://frontend.turing.edu/assets/images/static-comp-challenge-2.jpg). UnWined is a web page that allows users to document their favorite wine tasting experiences and share with others.
